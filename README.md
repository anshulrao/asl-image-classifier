# ASL (American Sign Language) Image Classifier
[Please refer to the report [here](https://github.com/anshulrao/asl-image-classifier/blob/master/files/Report.pdf) for a more thorough dive into the project.]

Convolutional neural networks were utilized to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) letters using different techniques.
I built and trained a CNN with three convolutional layers from scratch, and I also trained another one using a pre-trained model GoogLeNet. 
All of the models had accuracy levels exceeding 98 percent. Additionally, the incorrectly classified images were examined, and as a final step,
I developed a straightforward application that made use of the model to classify motions in real-time using webcam video.
